In order to make use of the Nearby features, create a file called 'secrets.properties' to store the Nearby API keys:

- API_KEY_DEBUG for the debug version of the app
- API_KEY_RELEASE for the release branch of the app.

Use  [the Getting Started Guide](https://developers.google.com/nearby/messages/android/get-started) to learn how to start.
